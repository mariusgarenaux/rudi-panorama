This is a light python web server based on streamlit whose aimed is to easily visualize all the metadata from a list of RUDI nodes.

No data is stored here, we simply use the rudi-node-read library to access open-data rudi-nodes?

## Getting started

You'll need to git clone the project : 

```
git clone <url_of_project>
```

Then, set-up a python venv : 

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
